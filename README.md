## terraform validator
`gcloud beta terraform vet`


In this demo, we will use `terraform` and  `gcloud beta terraform vet` to perform our policy validation process.  We will:

- Apply a constraint that enforces a domain restriction
    
- Test a constraint to intentionally throw a validation error
    
- Modify the constraint so that it passes validation
